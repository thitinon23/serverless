# Getting Started with the Serverless Framework and AWS

First things first, let's get the Serverless Framework open source CLI installed on your machine.

## Installing via npm

```bash
# Install the serverless cli
npm install -g serverless

# Or, update the serverless cli from a previous version
npm update -g serverless
```

If you don’t already have [Node 6](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) or higher on your machine, you’ll need to do that first.

## Installing as a standalone binary

_(no Node.js or npm installation required)_

### macOS & Linux

Run following code in your terminal:

```bash
curl -o- -L https://slss.io/install | bash
```

To upgrade already installed version:

```bash
serverless upgrade
```

### Windows

Install with [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) package manager:

```bash
choco install serverless
```

To upgrade already installed version:

```bash
choco upgrade serverless
```

## Serverless Dashboard

If you already registered for a [Serverless Framework Dashboard](https://dashboard.serverless.com) account, login to your account from the CLI.

```bash
serverless login
```

Once you have the Serverless Framework installed, simply run the `serverless` command and follow the prompts. In no time you will have deployed your first serverless app using the Serverless Framework [CLI](./providers/) and configured your [Serverless Framework Dashboard](./dashboard/) account to automatically monitor your serverless app, generate alerts, and much more. If you already have an existing Serverless Framework Dashboard account, you'll be prompted for your organization and application as well.

```bash
# Create and deploy a new service/project
serverless
```
